# bbb-optimize
Here are techniques to optimize and smoothly run your BigBlueButton server, including increasing recording processing speed, dynamic video profile, pagination, improving audio quality, fixing 1007/1020 errors and using apply-config.sh. 

Don't forget to restart your BigBlueButton server after making these changes
```sh
bbb-conf --restart
``` 

## Manage customizations

Keep all customizations of BigBlueButton server in apply-config.sh so that (1) all your BBB servers have same customizations without any errors, and (2) you don't lose them while upgrading.

We use XMLStarlet to update xml files and sed to update text files. 

```sh
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y xmlstarlet
git clone https://github.com/manishkatyan/bbb-optimize.git
cd bbb-optimize
cp apply-config-sample.sh apply-config.sh

# Edit apply-config.sh to set PUBLIC_IP to the public IP of your BBB server

# Apply changes and restart BBB
./replace-config.sh
```
Edit `apply-config.sh` as appropriate. Comments with each of the customizations will help you understand that the implication of each of them and you will be able to change the default values.  

## Match with your branding
```sh
# added to replace-config.sh. So no need to copy manually.
# cp default.pdf /var/www/bigbluebutton-default/
# cp favicon.ico /var/www/bigbluebutton-default/

bbb-conf --restart
```
You can update default BigBlueButton setup to match with your branding in the following ways:
1. Default PDF that would appear in the presentation area
2. Logo (favicon format) that would appear as favicon
3. Application name that would appear in "About" - right side menu
4. Welcome message that would appear on the public chat area
5. index.html that shows up when a user logs-out of a class. Create your own version and put it in `/var/www/bigbluebutton-default/`

In addition, you can change the following items in apply-config.sh:
1. clientTitle
2. appName
3. copyright
4. helpLink

## Disable Shared Notes and Lower Webcam resolution
```sh
# Edit /usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml and note > enabled > false

# Edit /usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml and set cameraProfiles > id: Low > default: true and cameraProfiles > id: Medium > default: false 
```
For K21 students, usually we disable Shared Notes, more to prevent users from writing inappropriate messages than to performance enhancement. 

We also lower default webcam resolution.

## Change recording processing speed
```sh
vi /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/lib/recordandplayback/generators/video.rb
```
Make the following changes on line 58 and line 124 to speed up recording processing time by 5-6 times:
`-quality realtime -speed 5 -tile-columns 2 -threads 4`

[Reference](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/8770)

Please keep in mind that it uses a more CPU which can affect the performance of live on-going classes on BigBlueButton.

Hence, its better to change the schedule of processing internal for recordings along with this change. 

## Use MP4 format for playback of recordings
The presentation playback format encodes the video shared during the session (webcam and screen share) as .webm (VP8) files.

You can change the format to MP4 for two reasons: (1) increase recording processing speed, and (2) enable playback of recordings on iOS devices.

Edit `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/presentation.yml` and uncomment the entry for mp4.
video_formats:
```sh 
#- webm
- mp4
```

## Dynamic Video Profile

aka automatic bitrate/frame rate throttling.   To control camera framerate and bitrate that scales according to the number of cameras in a meeting.
To decrease server AND client CPU/bandwidth usage for meetings with many cameras. Leads to significant difference in responsiveness, CPU usage and bandwidth usage (for the better) with this PR.

Edit `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml` and set
```sh
cameraQualityThresholds:
      enabled: true
```

## Video Pagination

You can control the number of webcams visible to meeting participants at a single time. 

Edit `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml` and set
```sh
pagination:
  enabled: true
```

## Stream better quality audio
Edit `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/config/default.yml` and make the following changes
```sh
maxaveragebitrate: "256000"
maxplaybackrate: "48000"
```

Edit `/opt/freeswitch/etc/freeswitch/autoload_configs/conference.conf.xml` and make the follwoing changes
```sh
<param name="interval" value="20"/>
<param name="channels" value="2"/>
<param name="energy-level" value="100"/>
```

Edit `/opt/freeswitch/etc/freeswitch/dialplan/default/bbb_conference.xml` and copy-and-paste the code below, removing the existig code

## Run three parallel Kurento media servers

Available in BigBluebutton 2.2.24 (and later releases of 2.2.x)

Running three parallel Kurento media servers (KMS) – one dedicated to each type of media stream – increases the stability of media handling as the load for starting/stopping media streams spreads over three separate KMS processes. Also, it increases the reliability of media handling as a crash (and automatic restart) by one KMS will not affect the two.

In our experience, we have see CPU usage spread across 3 KMS servers, resulting in better user experience. Hence, we highly recommend it. 

The change required to enable 3 KMS is part of our apply-config-sample.sh included with this project.

## Optimize NodeJS

The configuration change below can result in 40% improvement in NodeJS performance, allowing you to host up to 40% more concurrent users per server.

```sh
vi /usr/share/meteor/bundle/systemd_start.sh

# Replace the last line by PORT=3000 /usr/share/$NODE_VERSION/bin/node --max-old-space-size=4096 --max_semi_space_size=128 main.js

service bbb-html5 restart
```

## Optimize Recording

### Process multiple recordings

Make changes described in this PR: [Add option to rap-process-worker to accept a filtering pattern](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/8394)

```sh
Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-process-worker.service and set the command to: ExecStart=/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/rap-process-worker.rb -p "[0-4]$"
Copy /usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-process-worker.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-process-worker-2.service
Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-rap-process-worker-2.service and set the command to ExecStart=/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/rap-process-worker.rb -p "[5-9]$"
Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-record-core.target and add bbb-rap-process-worker-2.service to the list of services in Wants
Edit /usr/bin/bbb-record, search for bbb-rap-process-worker.service and add bbb-rap-process-worker-2.service next to it to monitor
```

You will also need to copy the updated version of `rap-process-worker.rb` from [here](https://github.com/daronco/bigbluebutton/blob/9e5c386e6f89303c3f15f4552a8302d2e278d057/record-and-playback/core/scripts/rap-process-worker.rb) to the following location `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts`

Ensure the right file permission `chmod +x rap-process-worker.rb`

After making the changes above restart recording process:
```sh
systemctl daemon-reload 	
systemctl stop bbb-rap-process-worker.service bbb-record-core.timer 	
systemctl start bbb-record-core.timer
```

To verify that the above changes have taken in place, execute the following:
```sh
ps aux | grep rap-process-worker
```

You should see the following two processes:
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/rap-process-worker.rb -p [5-9]$
/usr/bin/ruby /usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/rap-process-worker.rb -p [0-4]$
```
In case you don't see above two processes running, it's likely that you don't have any recording to process. You may want to record a test class using API-MATE and check if the above two processes start running after the end of the test class.

### Import already published recordings from one scalelite to another

To migrate existing, already published recordings, from one Scalelite server to another Scalelite server, follow the steps below:

* make a tar file from the old folder with a path in the form `presentation/<recording-id>/...`
* copy this tar file to `/mnt/scalelite-recordings/var/bigbluebutton/spool/` on the New scalelite server
* After a short while (a few minutes) the recording is automatically imported to the published folder by `scalelite-recording-importer` Docker service

### Secure recordings

With default BBB installation, anyone can share playback recording of your classes on Facebook or WhatsApp for everyone to view. 

To secure your recordings, you can make it accessible only from a certain domain. For example, allow recordings to be accessed from theh domain of your Moodle site.

```sh
# edit /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/presentation.nginx

  location /playback/presentation {
    root   /var/bigbluebutton;
    index index.html index.htm;

  # Restrict access
    valid_referers server_names
      bbb.youdomain.com;
    if ($invalid_referer) {
      return 404;
    }
  # End - Restrict access
  }

``` 

### Troubleshooting

To investigate the processing of a particular recording, you can look at the log files.

The `/var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-rap-worker` log is a general log file that can be used to find which section of the recording processing is failing. It also logs a message if a recording process is skipped because the moderator did not push the record button.

To investigate an error for a particular recording, check the following log files:
```sh
/var/log/bigbluebutton/archive-<recordingid>.log
/var/log/bigbluebutton/<workflow>/process-<recordingid>.log
/var/log/bigbluebutton/<workflow>/publish-<recordingid>.log
```

#### Check Free Disk Space
One common issue with recording is that your server is running out of free disk space. Here is how to check for disk space usage:

```sh
apt install ncdu
cd /var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation/
# On Scalelite server, check /mnt/scalelite-recordings/var/bigbluebutton/published/presentation for recordings
ncdu
``` 

You should also check disk space used by log files in `/var/log/bigbluebutton` and `/opt/freeswitch/log`. 

## Fix 1007 and 1020 errors

Follow the steps below to resolve 1007/1020 errors that your users may resport in case they are behind a firewall.

#### 1. Update `external.xml` and `vars.xml`
Edit `/opt/freeswitch/etc/freeswitch/sip_profiles/external.xml` and change
```xml
<param name="ext-rtp-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
<param name="ext-sip-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
```
To 
```xml
<param name="ext-rtp-ip" value="$${external_rtp_ip}"/>
<param name="ext-sip-ip" value="$${external_sip_ip}"/>
```

Edit `/opt/freeswitch/etc/freeswitch/vars.xml`, and change
```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_rtp_ip=stun:stun.freeswitch.org"/>
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_sip_ip=stun:stun.freeswitch.org"/>
```
To 
```xml
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_rtp_ip=EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"/>
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_sip_ip=EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"/>
```

#### 2. Verify Turn server is accessible 
Verify Turn server is accessible from your BBB serve. If you receive code 0x0001c means STUN is not working. Log into your BBB server and execute the following command: 

```sh
sudo apt install stun-client
stun <your-turn-server>
```
Here is another way to test whether your Stun server is accessible from your BBB server. 

Localport could be any available UDP port on your BBB server. 3478 is the port for the Stun server.

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y stuntman-client

stunclient --mode full --localport 30000 <your-stun-turn-server> 3478

```
Your output should be something like the following:

```sh
Binding test: success
Local address: <your-turn-server-ip>:30000
Mapped address: <your-turn-server-ip>:30000
Behavior test: success
Nat behavior: Direct Mapping
Filtering test: success
Nat filtering: Endpoint Independent Filtering
```

Configure BigBlueButton to use the coturn server by following the instruction [here](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/admin/setup-turn-server.html#configure-bigbluebutton-to-use-your-turn-server)

#### 3. Install Turn (Coturn) server:

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/admin/setup-turn-server.html) to install Turn server and configure `/etc/turnserver.conf` as mentioned below.

```sh
listening-port=3478 # stun server
tls-listening-port=443 # turn server
realm=FQDN of Turn server
```


We use ports 443 for Coturn server. Since the Coturn server does not run with root authorizations by default, it must not bind its services to privileged ports (port range <1024). Hence, edit the file `/lib/systemd/system/coturn.service` by executing `systemctl edit --full coturn` and add the following in `[Service]` section

If the TURN server is used by many users concurrently, it might hit the open file-handles limit. Therefore it is recommended to increase this limit by adding `LimitNOFILE=1048576` in the same file.

```sh
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
LimitNOFILE=1048576
# After saving, execute `systemctl daemon-reload`
# In case file /lib/systemd/system/coturn.service doesn’t exist, follow the tip here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47189606/configuration-coturn-on-ubuntu-not-working
```
Change ownership of certificates

```sh
# Change turn.higheredlab.com to FQDN of your coturn server
chown -hR turnserver:turnserver /etc/letsencrypt/archive/turn.higheredlab.com/
chown -hR turnserver:turnserver /etc/letsencrypt/live/turn.higheredlab.com/
```

Ensure that the coturn has binded to port 443 with netstat -antp | grep 443. Also restart your TURN server and ensure that coturn is running (and binding to port 443 after restart).

Ensure that the ufw firewall on your Turn server allows the following ports: 80, 443, 3478 and 49152:65535/udp. After running certbot, you can disable port 80. 

To make coturn automatically restart at reboot: `systemctl enable coturn`

To start coturn server: `systemctl start coturn`

To check the status of coturn server: `systemctl status coturn`

To view logs in real-time: `journalctl -u coturn -f` 

You can force using the TURN on Firefox browser. Open a Firefox tab and type `about:config`. Search for `media.peerconnection.ice.relay_only`. Set it to true. At this moment Firefox only use TURN relay. Now join a BigBlueButton session for this Firefox browser to see Turn server in action.
In another tab on Firefox, type `about:webrtc` to see the status of webrtc. Click on `show details` to see the url of stun/turn server being used with `success` message. 

Using Chrome to test: Type `chrome://webrtc-internals` in a Chrome browser. Reference: `https://testrtc.com/find-webrtc-active-connection/`

To see logs for testing purpose, you can manually start coturn server as follows: `turnserver -c /etc/turnserver.conf`

#### 4. Set external IP in WebRtcEndpoint.conf.ini 
Edit `/etc/kurento/modules/kurento/WebRtcEndpoint.conf.ini`

Mention external or public IP address of the media server by uncommenting the line below. Doing so has the advantage of not needing to configure STUN/TURN for the media server.
```sh
externalIPv4=Public-IP-of-BBB-Server
```

STUN/TURN are needed only when the media server sits behind a NAT and needs to find out its own external IP address. However, if you set a static external IP address as mentioned above, then there is no need for the STUN/TURN auto-discovery. Hence, comment the following: using turn.higheredlab.com (IP address)
```sh
#stunServerAddress=95.217.128.91
#stunServerPort=3478
```

#### 5. Verify your media negotiation timeouts. 
Recommend setting is to set `baseTimeout` to `60000` in `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml`


#### 6. Verify Turn is working
Visit `https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/` to check whether your Turn sevrer is working and enter the details below. Change Turn server URL to your Turn server URL.  
```sh
STUN or TURN URI: turn:turn.higheredlab.com:443?transport=tcp
TURN username:
TURN password: xxxx
```

Execute the code below to generate username and password. Replace `f23xxxea3841c9b91e9accccddde850c61` with the `static-auth-secret` from `/etc/turnserver.conf` file on the turn server.

```sh
secret=f23xxxea3841c9b91e9accccddde850c61 && \
time=$(date +%s) && \
expiry=8400 && \
username=$(( $time + $expiry )) &&\
echo username:$username && \
echo password : $(echo -n $username | openssl dgst -binary -sha1 -hmac $secret | openssl base64)
```
Then click `Add Server` and then `Gather candidates` button. If you have done everything correctly, you should see `Done` as the final result. If you do not get any response or if you see any error messages, please double check if you have diligently followed above steps.

## Change favicon of Greenlight
```sh
cd greenlight
mkdir cpp
#copy your favicon to greenlight/cpp
vi docker-compose.yml
#add the following line to volumes block and restart greenlight
- ${PWD}/cpp/favicon.ico:/usr/src/app/app/assets/images/favicon.ico
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

If you have installed Greenlight along with BigBlueButton (bbb-install.sh with -g flag), follow the steps above to change the favicon. Be careful with space and syntax, while adding the line above to volumes block in docker-compose.yml

## Change logo and copyright of Recordings
```sh
# copy your logo.png to /var/bigbluebutton/playback/presentation/2.0
# edit defaultCopyright in /var/bigbluebutton/playback/presentation/2.0/playback.js
```
Do you want to see your logo in recording playback? Simply copy your logo to thr playback directory as mentioned above.

Do you want to remove copyright message "Recorded with BigBlueButton"? Edit variable defaultCopyright in playback.js.

## GDPR

### No recording
```sh
# edit /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties
disableRecordingDefault=true
breakoutRoomsRecord=false
```
When a room is created in BigBlueButton that allows recordings (i.e., the recording button is visible) BigBlueButton will record the entire session. This is independent of the recording-button actually being pressed or not. A simpler solution is to stop recordings altogether.  
 
### No logs

#### 1. BigBlueButton logging
```
# BigBlueButton logs location: /var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-web.log. To limit this log, set
# (1) change appLogLevel from DEBUG to ERROR
vi /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties
# (2) change each logger level to ERROR (default INFO and DEBUG)
vi /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml

# To avoid logging ip-addresses in bbb-webrtc-sfu change log > level to error (default verbose)
vi /usr/local/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/config/default.yml

# To change logs level for chat usage and chat messages, change loglevel to ERROR
vi /etc/bbb-transcode-akka/application.conf (default INFO)
vi /etc/bbb-transcode-akka/logback.xml (default INFO, DEBUG, WARN]
vi /etc/bbb-apps-akka/application.conf (default DEBUG)
vi /etc/bbb-apps-akka/logback.xml (default INFO DEBUG)
```

#### 2. Nginx
```
# Nginx logs - change access log 
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
access_log /dev/null; (default /var/log/nginx/access.log)

# Nginx logs - change access log
vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton
access_log /dev/null; (default /var/log/nginx/bigbluebutton.access.log)
```

#### 3. Freeswitch
```
# Freeswitch logs - change loglevel and stdout-loglevel to ERROR (default DEBUG)
vi /etc/bbb-fsesl-akka/application.conf

# Freeswitch logs - change logger to ERROR (default INFO, DEBUG, WARN)
vi /etc/bbb-fsesl-akka/logback.xml
```

#### 4. Red5
```
# red5 - change root > level to ERROR and each logger to ERROR (default INFO)
vi /etc/red5/logback.xml
```
#### 5. Kurento
```
# export GST_DEBUG="1 ..." (Default is 3; Set it to 1, that is for Error)
vi /etc/default/kurento-media-server
```

#### 6. Greenlight

```
vi .env

# Comment the following live to send logs to log/production.log 
# RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true

# Create symlink, replacing $GREENLIGHTDIR with the absolute path where Greenlight is installed. 
ln -s /dev/null $GREENLIGHTDIR/log/production.log
```

#### 7. Scalelite
The Scalelite API container is logging user activities. For example: Who joined which meeting.
This logfile will never be deleted automatically and it will get quite large, if scalelite is serving many users.
Hence, delete logs via cronjobs.

```
# Login as root
crontab -e

# add to delete all Docker-Container-Logfiles. At 03:00 every sunday and thursday.
0 3 * * 0,4 truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*-json.log
```

#### 8. Coturn 
```
ln -s /dev/null /var/log/coturn.log
```

#### 9. Rotate Logs
If you want to keep logs, you can set days for which logs should be kept on the BBB server.
```
# Change log_history to 7 days (or as appropriate)
vi /etc/cron.daily/bigluebutton

# Change rotate to 7 (days) or as appropriate (this rotates log for /var/log/bigbluebutton/(bbb-rap-worker.log|sanity.log)
vi /etc/logrotate.d/bbb-record-core.logrotate

# Change rotate to 7 (days) or as appropriate (this rotates log for /var/log/bbb-webrtc-sfu/)
vi bbb-webrtc-sfu.logrotate

# Change MaxHistory to 7 (days) or as appropriate (this rotates log for /var/log/bigbluebutton/bbb-web.log)
vi /usr/share/bbb-web/WEB-INF/classes/logback.xml
```

### No Syslog entries
```ssh
# Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/bbb-htlm5.service
StandardOutput=null
# Restart
systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Change processing interval for recordings

Normally, the BigBlueButton server begins processing the data recorded in a session soon after the session finishes. However, you can change the timing for processing by stopping recordings process before beginning of classes and restarting it after ending of classes.

```sh
crontab -e

# Add the following entries
# Stop recording at 7 AM during week days
0 7 * * 1-5 systemctl stop bbb-rap-process-worker.service bbb-record-core.timer
# Start recording at 6 PM during week days; bbb-record-core will automatically launch all workers required for processing
0 18 * * 1-5 systemctl start bbb-record-core.timer
```

You should change the timezone of your BBB server to that of your users for accurate cron job scheduling above. 

```sh
# Current timezone
timedatectl

# List of available timezone
timedatectl list-timezones

# Set new timezone by replacing Asia/Kolkata with your timezone
timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
```

## Reboot BBB server

Rebooting BBB server every night would take care of any zombie process or memory leaks. 

```sh
crontab -e

# reboot every night at 10 PM
0 22   *   *   *    /sbin/shutdown -r +5
``` 

## Experimental

We are still testing the tips below. Use at your own discretion.

### Greenlight: Error

Do you get the following error in Greenlight: `Server Error - Invalid BigBlueButton Endpoint and Secret`

Of course you should verify that you have given correct BBB URL and Secret in .env file of Greenlight. 

In addition, you can try the following tip:

When BigBlueButton is running on a server, various component of BigBlueButton need to make connections to itself using the external hostname. Programs running within the BigBlueButton server that try to connect to the external hostname should reach BigBlueButton itself.

To enable the BigBlueButton server to connect to itself using the external hostname, edit file /etc/hosts and add the line
